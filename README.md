# Stream Archive Subtitler

This program generates subtitles from a text file with timestamps or json files from [chat_downloader](https://github.com/xenova/chat-downloader/). This can be used for instance to create an archive of a stream in another language that has a live translator providing translations in the chat. See [Usage](#usage) for how to do this

## Installation
To use this program, you will need to have Python 3 and pip installed. It is also recommended to install [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl), [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), and optionally [chat_downloader](https://github.com/xenova/chat-downloader/) to archive your stream and download the chat respectively.

Installation is as follows:

#### Recommended - Pip

Install via pip

Run the following in the terminal:

``` console
pip install stream_archive_subtitle
stream_archive_subtitle -h
```

#### Alternative - Build from source

1. Clone the repository by doing the following

	``` console
	$ git clone https://github.com/C-Elegans/stream_archive_subtitler.git

	```
	OR by downloading the [zip](https://github.com/C-Elegans/stream_archive_subtitler/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unzipping it somewhere convenient

	Note: using `git` is recommended as it makes updating easier

1. It is recommended to install the program under a python virtual environment, as this means the program and dependencies aren't installed globally on the system. The downside is you'll need to activate the environment to use the program
   - Create the environment by doing the following in a convenient folder:

   ``` console
   $ python -m venv .env
   ```
   Note: depending on the age of your system, you may need to replace `python` with `python3`
   - Activate the environment by doing the following:

   ``` console
   $ . .env/bin/activate
   ```
   - Deactivate the environment by typing `deactivate` into the terminal

1. Install the program's dependencies by doing the following:

   ``` console
   $ pip install -e .
   ```
   Note: depending on the age of your system, you may need to replace `pip` with `pip3`
1. Install the program by doing the following:

   ``` console
   $ python setup.py install
   ```
   Note: depending on the age of your system, you may need to replace `python` with `python3`
1. Test that the program has been installed correctly by running the following:

   ``` console
   $ stream_archive_subtitle -h
   ```
   It should output something like this:

   ```
   usage: stream_archive_subtitle [-h] -o OUTPUT [-t TRANSLATOR_FILTER] [-s START] files [files ...]

   Create a subtitle .srt file from korotagger or chat_downloader output

   positional arguments:
     files                 The korotagger or chat_downloader files to parse

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
   						The subtitle file to write to
     -t TRANSLATOR_FILTER, --translator-filter TRANSLATOR_FILTER
   						A regex to filter out translator messages (default: "\[[eE][nN]\]")
     -s START, --start START
   						Timestamp to control when the subtitles start from for archives that start in the middle of a stream
   						(default: 00:00:00)
   ```

## Usage

### Downloading a stream

If the stream you want to download is public, and assuming you have `youtube-dl` installed, all you need to do is:

``` console
$ youtube-dl 'https://youtube.com/whatever-your-stream-url-is'
```

However, if the stream is members-only, downloading the stream is a little more complicated. For full instructions see [this pastebin](https://pastebin.com/YkTzVNUK)

### Subtitling a Stream with Korotagger or a text file
Some live translators type their translations in discord, and use a bot like KoroTagger to collect their translations a couple of messages on discord. The messages look something like this:

```
some translated text here 1m50s
more translated text  2m10s
a long time later there's some more translated text here 1h32m10s
```

You can of course also manually create a text file like this if you want to manually subtitle a video.

To use this type of translation with this tool, copy and paste the discord messages into a file with the extension `.txt` such as `stream_translation.txt`.

Next run the tool like so:

``` console
$ stream_archive_subtitle -o subtitlefile.srt your_txt_file_here.txt

```

It will create a subtitle `.srt` file with a subtitle for each line in the text file. The `.srt` file can be used with ffmpeg as shown in [Adding Subtitles to a Video](#adding-subtitles-to-a-video)

### Subtitling a Stream with chat_downloader

Some live translators will provide translations directly in stream chat, prefixed with a tag like "[EN]" or "[ru]" or similar. This stream chat can be downloaded using [chat_downloader](https://github.com/xenova/chat-downloader/) by doing the following:

``` console
$ chat_downloader -o filename.json 'https://youtube.com/the-stream-url'
```

If your stream is a members' only one, you'll need to follow the procedure in [Downloading a Stream](#downloading-a-stream) to get the cookies.txt file, and pass it to `chat_downloader` like you did with `youtube-dl`:
``` console
$ chat_downloader -c cookies.txt -o filename.json 'https://youtube.com/the-stream-url'
```

Be patient, it takes a while, particularly if chat is particularly active

Once you have this `.json` file downloaded, generate the subtitle file by:
``` console
$ stream_archive_subtitle -o subtitlefile.srt your_txt_file_here.json

```

Note, since `stream_archive_subtitle` needs to filter needs to filter out only live translation comments for the subtitles to be properly generated. By default it looks for the regex "\[[eE][nN]\]" which will match the following tags: "[EN]", "[En]", "[eN]", and "[en]". If the tags in your stream look different (either because you want a different language or your live translator uses a different tag), you'll need to change the regular expression like so:

``` console
$ stream_archive_subtitle -o subtitlefile.srt --translator-filter '\[[rR][uU]\]' your_txt_file_here.json

```

In this case I changed it to match all of the RU tags instead of EN.

Note also that if you have both KoroTagger and chat_downloader translations and you want to combine them, just pass both files to the tool like so:

``` console
$ stream_archive_subtitle -o subtitlefile.srt chat_downloader_output.json korotagger_output.txt

```

It will automatically sort the subtitles by timestamp, giving you translations from both files at the appropriate times.

### Adding subtitles to a video

Once you have a video downloaded and a subtitle `.srt` file generated, you can add the subtitles to the video like so:

``` console
$ ffmpeg -i videofile.mov -i subtitles.srt -c copy -c:s mov_text videofile_out.mp4
```

If you have an archive downloaded that starts partway through the stream (say you started your download of a live stream a little late, or you downloaded only the second half of a youtube stream archive), and you still want subtitles, you will need to tell `stream_archive_subtitle` when your video started relative to the source video for the subtitles to line up. For instance, say I have an archive that starts 31 minutes and 53 seconds after the streamer began streaming. I would then pass an extra parameter `-s 00:31:53` to `stream_archive_subtitle` like so:

``` console
$ stream_archive_subtitle -s 00:31:53 -o subtitlefile.srt chat_downloader_output.json

```

The generated file can then be used to subtitle your video using `ffmpeg` as above.
